p4p_automate [false]	specifies if the SG/SGE to be executed after loading the P4P/CRS file (used in reap)
aromatic_rings [false]	specifies if the aromatic rings are to be automatically created
aromatic_rings_def [C5,C6,NC5,SC4,N2C3,NCNC2]	aromatic ring definitions
mouse_invert_zoom [false]	specifies if the mouse zooming operation to be inverted
mouse_click_threshold [2]	specifies the rectangular area size where the mouse click is recognised
hbond_min_angle [120]	the minimal angle for H-bonds to exist
preserve_invalid_ins [false]	if invalid instructions are preserved vs being deleted
q_peak_min_alpha [0]	minimum value for the Q-peak transparency (0-0.75)
tooltip_occu_chem [true]	tooltip shows chemical occupancy vs crystallographic one
gl_selection [true]	to use the OpenGl selection implementation. If False - a more limited but working more precise with some drivers implementation is used. It however does not allow the selection of objects which use textures (unless treated specifically) or colours.
gl_multisample [true]	enables smoothing of the rendering, though reducing the performance it produces better quality picture
gl_stereo [true]	enables stereo buffers. Note that if this option is enabled and your graphics card does not support stereo buffers, gl_multisample option will be turned off by default at first Olex2 run. However, on exit, Olex2 will check this and will disable this option so that multisampling will work
preserve_restraint_defaults [false]	if set, the default restraint values/weights are shown in the ins file. This option has no effect when DEFS instruction is set
preserve_fvars	preserves the even if they are referred only once
safe_afix [True]	checks AFIXes are correct after atom naming, deleting and HAdd
confirm_on_close [True]	asks a confirmation question before closing the application
profile [False]	switches application profiling on/off
interactions_from [H]	sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
interactions_to [N,O,F,Cl,S,Br,Se,I]	sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
absolute_hkl_path [false]	saves absolute path in the INS file
group_restraints [false]	groups restraints by involved atoms
stack_restraints [true]	add new restraints to the bottom of the restraint list
use_hkl_cell [true]	if HKL file has CELL instruction - Olex2 overrides current file CELL with parameters from the HKL
path []	extensions to the system PATH (prepended)
max_label_length [4]	new ShelXl will support longer labels in the INS file
locale.ctype []	default locale. You may need to use en_US.utf8 for Linux/Mac
cif.use_md5 [false]	embeds MD5 checksums for HKL/FAB/RES into the CIF
rename_parts [true]	disallow identical labels within different parts
model.center_on_reload [true]	re-centres the model on the file re-read (like after the refinement)
model.center_on_update [true]	re-centres the model when it is updated (like atoms split)
external_editor []	you can set notepad++ as an Editor for EditAtom, use like 
 "c:\p..f\notepad++.exe" -multiInst
  Use %f as a file name placeholder if order of arguments matters.
external_explicit_same [false]	writes olex2.same file vs SAME embedded into the atom list. This gives more flexibility as it does not enforce atom order in the reference SAME groups
explicit_same [false]	writes expands SAME just before the INS END rather than to an external file.
As above, this gives more flexibility as it does not enforce atom order in the reference SAME groups
exyz_separation [0.5]	separation for EXYZ atoms in special rendering mode
on_loaded_file[] - an action to perform when a file the user tries to load is opened in another Olex2 instance. [Y]-proceed with loaading, [N]-do not open any files, [C]-close this instance and bring the other to the front
